Please refer to Chang, Taylor, Rastle and Monaghan (2020) paper for the model architecture and training/testing procedures.
The simulations are run using the Mikenet simulator.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Simulation 2 folder contains the files for training and testing the artificial word leanring and english reading model. 
The compiled versions are bulit using Mac terminal, with the Mikenet simulator installed.
