Please refer to Chang, Taylor, Rastle and Monaghan (2020) paper for the model architecture and training/testing procedures.
The simulations are run using the Mikenet simulator.

Simulation 1 folder contains all of the files needed to train and test the simulations.
The compiled versions are bulit using Mac terminal, with the Mikenet simulator installed.

Weight files:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Oral: Weight files of the five versions of the artificial word learning model with different levels of proficiency, including the weights for the speaking task (SP), for the hearing task (PS) and the combination of both (Oral).

Reading: Weight files of the five versions of the OP focused and OS focused model at the end of the reading training with different levels of proficiency.
